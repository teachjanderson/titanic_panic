# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis through Jupyter Notebook. Further analysis will be completed using Python functions.

## Database Storage
SQLite is the database we intend to use. We intend to use Tableau to display the data as well as on our powerpoint slide. 

## Machine Learning
We are using supervised machine learning methods to predict the survivability of passengers aboard the Titanic within their classification. 

## Dashboard
We will design a Tableau dashboard with interactive elements based on the classifications used in the machine learning model.
