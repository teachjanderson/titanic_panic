# Machine Learning of Titanic Data
Our project uses machine learning to determine survival rates aboard the Titanic. We selected this dataset based on our interest in the historical event and using the detailed information to make machine learning predictions. Our data source is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) and includes 12 columns of nearly 900 rows about individual passengers. For each passenger, there is information about their survival status, age, gender, class, and even the fare he or she paid for the trip. We focused on the variables of gender and class to predict the likelihood of survival. The original dataset is split into multiple CSV files and required merging via SQL Joins. 

# Hypothesis and Questions
* Hypothesis: The class of passenger impacts the survival rate aboard the Titanic.
* Alternative: The gender of passengers impacts the survival rate aboard the Titanic. 
* Null Hypothesis: The class of passenger does not impact the survival rate aboard the Titanic. 
* Does gender impact survival odds aboard the Titanic? 
* Does class of passenger impact survival odds aboard the Titanic?
* Can we achieve an machine learning accuracy rate above 80%?
