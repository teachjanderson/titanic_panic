# Descripton of Features
Our original dataset contained twelve different features. We chose to focus on and keep four of these features for our machine learning model. Those 
features were passenger ID, whether the passenger survived or not, passenger gender, and the economic class of each passenger. For this project, our team
wanted to see if we were able to predict survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on passenger gender and economic class. These specific features
were chosen due to our background knowledge of the Titanic and that women and children were two of the groups to be ushered to safety first. Additionally,
we also inferred that higher class ranking passengers would more likely have a higher change of survival given the placement of their cabins (upper deck) on the boat
as well as their privelege may have also allowed them a spot on a lifeboat.
Given that we knew the outcome of the survival rate of the passengers, we were able to use a supervised machine learning method with "Survival" as our target feature.
