# Machine Learning of Titanic Data
Our project will be using machine learning to determine which variables have an impact on survival rates aboard the Titanic. The Reason we selected this as our project is due to our interest in the historical event and the dataset included a variety of information to analyze in our machine learning model. Our data source is from [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). The dataset is split into multiple CSV files and will require merging via SQL Joins. 

# Hypothesis and Questions
* Hypothesis: The class of passenger impacts the survival rate aboard the Titanic.
* Alternative: The gender of passengers impacts the survival rate aboard the Titanic. 
* Null Hypothesis: The class of passenger does not impact the survival rate aboard the Titanic. 
* Does gender impact survival odds aboard the Titanic? 
* Does class of passenger impact survival odds aboard the Titanic?
* Can we achieve an machine learning accuracy rate above 80%?


Information on Data Storage and Use of Systems for project
We plan on using Postgres SQL to hold our data. 
We will be using PPT to present our data.
We will be using Tableu to make our dashboard.

# Communication Protocols 
* Slack, Zoom, Github
