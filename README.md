# Machine Learning of Titanic Data
Our project will be using machine learning to determine which variables have an impact on survival rates aboard the Titanic. The Reason we selected this as our project is due to our interest in the historical event and the dataset included a variety of information to analyze in our machine learning model. Our data source is from [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). The dataset is split into multiple CSV files and will require merging via SQL Joins. 

# Hypothesis and Questions
* Hypothesis: The class of passenger impacts the survival rate aboard the Titanic.
* Alternative: The gender of passengers impacts the survival rate aboard the Titanic. 
* Null Hypothesis: The class of passenger does not impact the survival rate aboard the Titanic. 
* Does gender impact survival odds aboard the Titanic? 
* Does class of passenger impact survival odds aboard the Titanic?
* Can we achieve an machine learning accuracy rate above 80%?

# Machine Learning Model, Database/Storage, and Use of Project Systems
The project will use Postgres SQL to hold and manage our data along with SQL to run queries prior to using our Machine Learning model. The final presentation will make use of Microsoft Powerpoint / Google Slides and Tableau. 

# Communication Protocols 
The team communication protocols include briefing before and after each class session along with agreed upon norms for communication including Slack for sharing links, general requests, and support questions. Our team will meet live on Zoom using created channel and using class breakout rooms. The project deliverables are hosted on Github using branches and approving merges as deliverables are completed.
